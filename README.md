# Auger

The Auger library implements a ruby DSL for describing tests to be run
against remote applications on multiple servers. The gem includes
'aug', a multi-process command-line client.

The primary goal of Auger is test-driven operations: unit testing for
application admins. The library can also be used as a framework for
implmenting automated tests.

These are the sorts of questions auger can answer:

* is port :80 on my application webservers open? does /index.html
    contain a response tag that we know should be served from a given
    backend data source?

* is redis running? is it configured as a master? a slave?

* is elasticsearch responding on all my hosts it should be? what's
    the cluster state? do I have the number of data nodes responding
    that we're supposed to have?

Clearly a lot of this information includes things you should be
graphing. What auger wants to do is give you a quick overview
of current status: green == good, red == ruh roh!

## Plugins

Specific protocols are implemented using plugins, which are designed
to be easy to write wrappers on existing gems. Auger currently includes
the following plugins:

* socket - test whether a port is open
* telnet - send arbitrary commands to a port using `net/telnet`
* http - http and https requests using `net/http`
* redis - query redis db info, keys, etc
* dns - domain and query requests for testing a DNS server

## Installation

    gem install auger

### If you want to run the latest source:

    git clone git@github.com/brewster/auger
    cd auger; bundle install && rake install

## Command-line client usage

`aug -h` will print usage details.

Sample configs are included in `auger/cfg/examples` (if installed as a
gem, look in `$GEM_HOME/gems/auger-x.x.x/cfg/examples`). Use them as a
basis to write your own tests, which auger can find in one of three ways:

* in the directory `auger/cfg`
* from the config load path defined in environment variable `AUGER_CFG`.
  e.g. `AUGER_CFG=~/aug_cfg/prod:~/aug_cfg/staging`
* using a relative path

Reference config files using `aug foo`, to find `foo.rb` in
`auger/cfg` or `AUGER_CFG` path, or `aug path/to/foo.rb` to find it directly.

`aug -l` will print available config files in `AUGER_CFG` path.

### Example 1 - testing a webserver response

```ruby
project "Front-end Web Servers" do
  server "web-fe-[01-02]"

  http 8000 do
    get '/' do
      test 'status code is 200' do |response|
        response.code == '200'
      end
    end
  end

end
```

The `project` command takes a project description, and a block containing multiple
tests to be run together for that project.

`server` lists hosts that should be tested. It may be called multiple times, and
also parses host range expressions using the HostRange gem.

`http` is an example of a connection, it takes an argument with the port to
connect, and a block containing multiple requests to make.

`get` is a request, in this case an HTTP GET to the provided url, and takes a block
with multiple tests to run on the response. Plugins can return any object from
a request, in the case of `http` the response is an HTTP::Reponse object.

`test` describes a test to run on the provided response; it takes a description,
and the response is passed to a block. The result of executing the block is
presented as the result of this test (in this case true or false).

For better control over the result, it is possible to construct and
return an Auger::Result object, with an outcome (string to be
printed) and a boolean status (which aug client will use to print
the result in green or red), for example:

```ruby
    test 'http status code' do |response|
      Result(response.code, response.code == '200')
    end
```

will always show the code, in green if 200, red otherwise.

Save the config to a file `fe_web` and run with the `aug` command:

    $ aug ./fe_web
    [web-fe-01]
      status code is 200  ✓
    [web-fe-02]
      status code is 200  ✓

### Example 2 - adding more tests

Let's extend our example to be more interesting.

```ruby
project "Front-end Web Servers" do
  server 'web-fe-[01-02]', :web
  server 'www.mydomain.com', :vip, :port => 80

  socket 8000 do
    roles :web
    open? do
      test "port 8000 is open?"
    end
  end

  http 8000 do
    roles :web, :vip

    get '/' do
      test 'status code is 200' do |response|
        response.code == '200'
      end

      test 'document title' do |response|
        response.body.match /<title>([\w\s]+)<\/title>/
      end
    end

    get '/image.png' do
      header 'user-agent: Auger Test'

      test 'image.png has correct content-type' do |respose|
        response['Content-Type'] == 'image/png'
      end
    end
  end

end
```

Servers can have roles attached to them, in this case `:web` and
`:vip`. By default a connection will be run for all servers, but the
`roles` command allows connections to be limited to the given roles.

Servers can also have a hash of options, which will override
the matching connection options for just that server. In this case
we want to connect to port 80 on the vip rather than 8000.

Server names may be given as strings (which will be parsed by HostRange),
as arrays (or expressions returning arrays), or as a block returning
an array. All arrays will be flattened. Hence the following are all
equivalent:

```ruby
server "foo1", "foo2", "foo3"
server "foo[1-3]"
server HostRange.parse("foo[1-3]")
server [ "foo1", "foo2", "foo3" ]
server do
  %w{ foo1 foo2 foo3 }
end
```

The `header` command demonstrates setting options for a request,
in this case setting an http request header.

The `socket` command creates a connection to the given port, and
`open?` returns true if the port is open. We just apply this to
the real web servers and not the vip.

The document title test demonstrates how to extract and return a regex
match.  Tests can return almost any object (including Exceptions), and
auger will try to display the result using the `.to_s` method. Ruby's
MatchData object, however, gets special treatment. If the MatchData
has captures (captured using parentheses in the regex) they will be
displayed, as in this case. If no captures, the MatchData will be
treated as a boolean. The `aug` cmdline client displays booleans with
a checkmark or an 'x'.

### Example 3 - testing ElasticSearch

```ruby
require 'json'

project "Elasticsearch" do
  server 'prod-es-[01-04]'

  http 9200 do
    get "/_cluster/health" do

    # this runs after request returns, but before tests
    # use it to munge response body from json string into a hash
    before_tests do |r|
      r.body = JSON.parse(r.body)
    end

    test "Status 200" do |r|
      r.code == '200'
    end

    # Now we'll define an array called stats, which contains all the keys we
    # want to retrieve values from in our /_cluster/health output.  In this
    # case, we'll just return the body of the response, as it's relatively
    # small. You can of course parse this however you'd like for this or
    # other cases.
    stats = %w[
      cluster_name
      status
      timed_out
      number_of_nodes
      number_of_data_nodes
      active_primary_shards
      active_shards
      relocating_shards
      initializing_shards
      unassigned_shards
    ]

    stats.each do |stat|
      test "#{stat}" do |r|
        r.body[stat]
      end
    end

    # I've discovered that a typical fail case with elasticsearch is
    #   that on occassion, nodes will come up and not join the cluster
    # This is an easy way to see if the number of nodes that the host
    #   actually sees (actual_data_nodes) matches what we're
    #   expecting (expected_data_nodes).
    # TODO: dynamically update expected_data_nodes based on defined hosts:
    test "Expected vs Actual Nodes" do |r|
      r.body['number_of_data_nodes'] == 8
    end

  end

end
```

## Writing plugins

Let's look at a simplified http plugin.

```ruby
require "net/http"

module Auger

  class Project
    def http(port = 80, &block)
      @connections << Http.load(port, &block)
    end
  end

  class Http < Auger::Connection
    def open(host, options)
      http = Net::HTTP.new(host, options[:port])
      http.start
      http
    end

    def close(http)
      http.finish
    end

    def get(url, &block)
      @requests << Auger::HttpRequest.load(url, &block)
    end
  end

  class HttpRequest < Auger::Request
    def run(http)
      get = Net::HTTP::Get.new(@arg)
      http.request(get)
    end
  end

end
```

First, we add the `http` method to the Project class. This simply causes
the 'http' command to add a connection of class Http to the project's
list of connections.

Next, we define the Http connection class by sub-classing `Auger::Connection`.
A connection class needs to define `open` and `close` methods, which will
create and destroy a connection object (in this case a Net::HTTP object).
`open` takes a hostname and the connection @options hash, and returns an
instance of the relevant request object.


## Command Line Auto-completion for aug tool

BASH completion (with file completion and a rolling cache, if you're incredibly impatient like me):
```bash
_augcomp()
{
  count=100
  augcache="/tmp/.aug_cache"
  augcounter="/tmp/.aug_counter"

  # if the cache or the counter don't exist, create
  if [ ! -f "$augcache" ] || [ ! -f "$augcounter" ]
  then
    aug -l >$augcache && echo 0 >$augcounter
  else
    # if the counter reaches $count, re-generate the complete list
    if [ $(cat "$augcounter") -eq "$count" ]
    then
      aug -l >$augcache && echo 0 >$augcounter
    # if the counter hasn't reached $count, increment it
    else
      expr $(cat $augcounter) + 1 >$augcounter
    fi
  fi
  augcfgs=$(cat "$augcache" | xargs)

  word=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}

  _compopt_o_filenames
  COMPREPLY=($(compgen -f -W "$augcfgs" -- "${word}"))
}
complete -F _augcomp aug
```

ZSH completion:

    _augprojects () { _files; compadd $(aug -l) }
    compdef _augprojects aug
